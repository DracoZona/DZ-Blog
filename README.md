## Topics

- Cybersecurity related topics

- Reviews on any tech related thing that I encounter or something.
- Tender Juicy Hatdog

## Publications

I will try to publish new blogs about the things I do and the machines I hack. But most probably someone had already published the same content though I'll still do it and share my thought process if that helps.
