# Introduction

Hello! I decided to take the `Active Directory Exploitation` track on HackTheBox.

_Active Directory Exploitation_

I don't know. Just to get my feet wet with AD attacks since I am planning to take the CPTS exam within this year. 
So in the list of machines, this is the first machine and it is entitled "CICADA". Cool name and it is labeled easy. Is it? You'll see as you read further on my blog.

# Recon and Enum Phase

First, I ran an nmap scan to check for open ports:

``` terminal
nmap -sCV -p- --min-rate 300 -vv <IP> -Pn
```

While waiting for that to finish, it was indicated in the scan that there was port 139 and 445 and it was open. From that information, I fired up another terminal and 
use crackmapexec to enumerate shares if that is possible. 

``` terminal
crackmapexec smb <IP> -u "" -p "" --shares
```

_Enumerating Shares using CrackMapExec_

I have found 2 shares that has READ permissions. HR and IPC$. So I tried to connect to the HR share to see if I am allowed to do that and if so, to check if there are 
files that could be useful.
![Desktop View](/assets/img/ad-series-1/ss2.png){: width="982" height="800" }
_File Found in HR Share_

There is one file entitled "Notice from HR.txt" that I found. I checked its contents and I found out that this was a welcome message to new hires and it was indicated in the message the default password that was provided to them. That is so juicy.
![](/assets/img/ad-series-1/ss3.png){: width="982" height="800" }
_Default Password for New Hires was Found_

At this point, I was thinking maybe that there is a user who still uses the default password. You never know, right? So I fired up `crackmapexec` to enumerate users, but it shows nothing.

``` terminal
crackmapexec smb <> -u "" -p "" --shares
```
![](/assets/img/ad-series-1/ss4.png){: width="982" height="800" }
_No results from CME_

So I tried using another tool. I used `lookupsid` that is from `impacket`.
> **lookupsid** is a tool that allows attackers to enumerate user SIDs (Security Identifiers) and group SIDs on a Windows System.
{: .prompt-info }

Using `lookupsid` tool, I was able to retrieve the list of users.
![](/assets/img/ad-series-1/ss5.png){: width="982" height="800" }
_Username Enumeration using lookupsid tool_

With the list of users and the default password I got from the file, I executed a passwordspray attack using `netexec`.
```
nxc smb <IP> -u domain_users.txt -p <password> --continue-on-success
```
So it seemed that `Michael Wrightson` did not change his default password. What a shame :<>
![](/assets/img/ad-series-1/ss6.png){: width="982" height="800" }
_User Michael Wrightson was still using his default password_

I used the credentials of Michael to further enumerate users to check if there are any juicy information that I could retrieve from them.
```
nxc smb <IP> -u "michael.wrightson" -p <password> --users
```
After executing the command, I found a user that has a description about his password. So now I also have the credentials of David Orelious. This is getting interesting. 
![](/assets/img/ad-series-1/ss7.png){: width="982" height="800" }
_User David had his password written in the description_

Since I've got 2 users with credentials already and I tried checking if I can use them to access the DEV share that I found earlier. The user `David` was the one that got in.
```
smbclient -U david.orelious \\\\<IP>\\DEV
```
 I found a powershell script inside the share which was interesting since the filename was `Backup_script.ps1`
 ![](/assets/img/ad-series-1/ss8.png){: width="982" height="800" }
_Found a powershell script in DEV share_

I looked into the file and I found another user and its password! 
 ![](/assets/img/ad-series-1/ss9.png){: width="982" height="800" }
_Another user credentials found in the script_

# Gaining Initial Foothold

This is the part where I gained initial access. I used the credentials of emily to initiate remote connection using `evil-winrm` tool. 
> **evil-winrm** is a tool that provides remote shell access to Windows machines over WinRM (Windows Remote Management)
{: .prompt-warning }

```
evil-winrm -i <IP> -u emily.oscars -p <password>
```
I have now a remote access through the user `Emily`.

_Initial Foothold_

At this point, I got myself into a rabbit hole, so I'm gonna skip that part where I go back and forth with some things and go directly on how to escalate privileges. 

# Privilege Escalation

First I checked which privileges I got using the user `Emily`. I found out that it has `SeBackupPrivilege` set to `Enabled`.
 ![](/assets/img/ad-series-1/ss12.png){: width="982" height="800" }
_SeBackupPrivilege was enabled_
> **SeBackupPrivilege** is a User Right Assignment in Windows Active Directory (AD) that allows a user or process to bypass file and directory security restrictions for backup purposes. Attackers who gain this privilege can bypass access controls and read sensitive files, including NTDS.dit (which contains AD password hashes). It can be abused to escalate privileges by copying and extracting credentials from SAM, SYSTEM, or other critical files.
{: .prompt-danger }

I made a backup of SAM and SYSTEM using `reg save` command and downloaded them to my machine.

_Reg Save_

Using the tool `secretsdump.py` I was able to dump the hash of the Administrator.

_Dumping Administrator Hashes_

With the Administrator hash I got, I used Pass the Hash attack to successfully logged in as Administrator.

_Admin Access_

# Conclusion
That's how I completed this challenge. Thank you for reading! I hope you learned something from here.
